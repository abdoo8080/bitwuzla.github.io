# About Bitwuzla

Bitwuzla is a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver for the theories of
fixed-size bit-vectors, floating-point arithmetic, arrays and uninterpreted
functions and their combinations.

Its name is derived from an Austrian dialect expression that can be translated
as "<span class="orange">someone who tinkers with bits</span>".

### "Bitwuzla" is pronounced as "<span class="orange">*bitvootslah*</span>"
